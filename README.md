# HarmonAIze

An open-source toolkit that streamlines the process of harmonising and integrating climate and health data. Designed for research teams in resource-constrained settings, it leverages AI-assisted workflows to map, clean, and unify heterogeneous datasets, all while preserving privacy through federated approaches.

## Getting Started

**The main application is located in the `harmonaize/` directory.**
