## Integration Capabilities

### Ready for Core Module Integration
- Designed to work with existing geocoding functionality
- Sample data structure matches expected clinical location format
- Compatible with Google Earth Engine API integration
- Maintains existing climate module database models

### API Endpoints Enhanced
- `/climate/api/variables/`: Get available climate variables by data source
- `/climate/api/request/{id}/status/`: Real-time request status checking
- Ready for additional endpoints as needed

## Data Structure Examples

### Clinical Locations Format
```python
{
    'name': 'Maputo Central Hospital, Mozambique',
    'lat': -25.9653,
    'lon': 32.5892,
    'clinic_type': 'Central Hospital'
}
```

### Climate Variables
```python
{
    'temperature_mean': 'Mean Temperature (°C)',
    'temperature_max': 'Maximum Temperature (°C)',
    'precipitation_total': 'Total Precipitation (mm)',
    'humidity_relative': 'Relative Humidity (%)',
    'wind_speed': 'Wind Speed (m/s)'
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation throughout climate module
- Clear section headers and consistent styling
- Quick action buttons on dashboard
- Direct links between related pages

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states with animated progress bars
- Status badges with appropriate colors
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Real-time updates for long-running processes

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Readable typography on small screens
- Consistent experience across devices

## Future Integration Notes

### Geocoding Module Connection
The demo is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing geocoding module by:
- Using realistic African clinical coordinate data
- Supporting the same location data structure
- Providing clear API endpoints for data exchange

### Climate API Integration
Ready for connection with external climate services:
- Google Earth Engine integration points identified
- Standardized data format for climate variables
- Error handling for API failures
- Caching strategy for performance

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access Landing Page**: Visit `/climate/` for module overview
2. **Try Interactive Demo**: Use `/climate/demo/` to see workflow simulation
3. **View API Docs**: Reference `/climate/api-docs/` for development
4. **Monitor Requests**: Use enhanced dashboard for real-time tracking
5. **Review Improvements**: Check `/climate/improvements/` for full changelog

## Minimal Impact on Main App
